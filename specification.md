# The Giant Program — Specification & Change Log

The living record of **what** has been built and **when** — it grows with the app.
Complements the other two docs (don't duplicate them):
- **`ARCHITECTURE.md`** (`Downloads/ARCHITECTURE.md`) — the domain and the *why*.
- **`CONVENTIONS.md`** (kept in `Downloads/Claude/`) — *how* the code is built.

## How to maintain this file
On every feature or fix, add a dated entry under a `## YYYY-MM-DD` heading
(**newest first**), one concise line per change, tagged `feat` / `fix` / `chore` /
`docs` and noting the area touched. Keep it factual — this is the project's history,
not marketing. Update **Current capabilities** when a change adds or removes a
user-facing capability.

---

## Current capabilities

- **Single-user auth** (Supabase email/password, RLS-protected).
- **Today** — date-computed position; full session prescription (warm-up, clean
  block on dips day, Giant Block, volume, carry) and logging. **Optional session
  timer:** Start → live timer → End, duration derived from `started_at`/`ended_at`,
  90-min auto-end safeguard, manual duration edit.
- **Calendar** — 15-week × Mon/Wed/Fri grid; log/edit/delete any session; mark breaks.
- **History** — latest top sets, recent-session feed, pull-up cluster trend, testing results.
- **Deload** — per-week fatigue signals + reactive-deload recommend/apply (advise-and-confirm).
- **Setup** — per-cycle (C1/C2/C3) working-weights grid + cleans/carries, macro anchor,
  macro picker, and "start next macro" archiving (carries C3→C1).
- **Pull-ups** — phase-1 bodyweight cluster logging (OHP day) + trend. *(Phase-2 weighted: deferred.)*
- **Testing weeks** — record 2–3RM results per lift.
- **Global loading states** — instant splash on reload + slim top progress bar on data loads.
- **Deployed** to GitHub Pages: https://zsolt17.github.io/giant-programV2/ (auto-deploy on push to `main`).

## Change log

## 2026-06-24
- `feat`: **session timer on Today** — optional Start/End timer, three states
  (not-started: prescription locked + "Start session"; running: live mm:ss + "End
  session"; completed: duration + editable "Edit (min)" + "Update"). Backed by
  `started_at`/`ended_at` (`timestamptz`, migration `0002_session_timer.sql`);
  duration is always **derived**, never stored. Clock is recomputed from
  `started_at` each render, so it survives sleep / backgrounding / reopen. **90-min
  auto-end safeguard** (evaluated from `started_at`, fires even if the app was
  closed) caps the end and appends "auto-ended at 90 min". No auto-start. Files:
  `Today.jsx` (timer + `TimerBar`), `SessionForm.jsx` (`locked` prop), `mappers.js`.
  Verified end-to-end incl. auto-end persistence. *(SessionModal duration edit for
  past sessions still to come.)*
- `feat`: **error boundary** — a render crash now shows a branded recovery screen
  with a Reload button instead of a blank page (`ErrorBoundary.jsx`, wrapping `App`
  in `main.jsx`).
- `fix`: **save handlers surface failures** — `try/catch` + visible "couldn't save —
  retry" on session, calendar-modal, and testing-result saves (and delete), so a
  failed write (e.g. flaky gym wifi) no longer silently sticks on "Saving…" and lose
  the entry (`Today.jsx`, `SessionModal.jsx`, `TestingResultForm.jsx`).
- `chore(ci)`: deploy workflow now runs `npm test` before `npm run build` — engine
  tests gate the deploy (`deploy.yml`).
- `fix(mobile)`: iOS date inputs were overflowing their card (native intrinsic
  width) — added `-webkit-appearance:none` via a shared `DATE_INPUT` style applied to
  both Setup date fields so they respect their container (`Setup.jsx`). This is the
  actual cure for the iOS date-input sizing saga (min-width/stacking only mitigated it).
- `feat`: **sticky tab nav** — the menu pins to the top of the viewport on scroll so
  it's always reachable (e.g. at the bottom of the Calendar) (`components.jsx` Tabs).
- `fix(mobile)`: **stacked** the Macro start / Macro # fields vertically — the
  `min-width:0` approach didn't hold for the iOS native date input in standalone
  (home-screen) mode; stacking removes the side-by-side overlap entirely (`Setup.jsx`).
- `fix(mobile)`: (superseded by the above) tried `min-width:0` on the grid items +
  `min-width:0`/`max-width:100%` on the shared input style for the date-input overflow
  (`theme.js`, `Setup.jsx`).
- `feat`: global loading indicators — instant pre-React splash baked into
  `index.html` (removed on mount via `main.jsx`) + `TopLoadingBar` shown during data
  loads; first load keeps the centered spinner, reloads keep content (`App.jsx`,
  `components.jsx`, `global.css`).
- `fix(mobile)`: sign-out button no longer overlaps the title (moved to its own
  right-aligned row); separated the Macro start / Macro # fields (`components.jsx`,
  `Setup.jsx`).
- `docs`: added `CONVENTIONS.md` (cross-project reference, kept in `Downloads/Claude/`)
  and this `specification.md`.

## 2026-06-23
- `chore(ci)`: bumped `actions/checkout` + `setup-node` to v5 (Node 24 runtime).
- `fix(deploy)`: locked GitHub Pages source to "GitHub Actions" (`build_type: workflow`)
  after a legacy branch-build raced and served the raw source `index.html`.
- `feat`: **deployed** to GitHub Pages — `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` builds the
  Vite app and publishes on push to `main`; `vite.config.js` base `/giant-programV2/`
  for builds; public Supabase keys committed in `.env.production`.
- `feat`: **full rebuild** of the app — monolithic single-file `index.html` → modular
  Vite + React + Supabase. Delivered in 8 verified steps:
  1. Supabase schema + RLS + single-user auth (`supabase/migrations/0001_init.sql`).
  2. Data layer — `supabase.js` / `mappers.js` / `repository.js` (only files that touch the backend).
  3. Date engine + loading math ported verbatim into `src/engine/` with unit tests.
  4. **Per-cycle working weights** in Setup — the motivating fix (a session reads its
     own cycle's weights; logging a C1 session no longer prefills C3).
  5. Today + shared `SessionForm` + Calendar.
  6. Reactive deload rule + History + Deload tabs (+ `fmt` made null-safe — a weightless
     session was crashing the calendar/history).
  7. Pull-up cluster logging (phase 1).
  8. Testing-result logger + multi-macro archiving.

## ≤ 2026-06-22 (pre-rebuild)
- Original single-file app: `index.html` (React via CDN) on a Google Sheets backend,
  hosted on GitHub Pages. Superseded by the 2026-06-23 rebuild; preserved in git history.
